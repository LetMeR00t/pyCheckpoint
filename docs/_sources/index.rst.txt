## Overview
Checkpoint firewalls solution are now using a well detailed API. This SDK simplifies software development using the Checkpoint Firewall API in Python.

This SDK is based on the [Checkpoint official API documentation](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/latest/APIs/#introduction~v1.8%20).

This SDK leverages the [RESTfly framework](https://restfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) developed by Steve McGrath.

This SDK implementation was largely inspired from the [pyZscaler](https://github.com/mitchos/pyZscaler) SDK development.
